      <h2 class="section-title">Hi — I’m Remegio P. Cabalida Jr.</h2>

      <article class="about-text">
        <p><strong>Age:</strong> 25</p>
        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Puso, Poblacion, Cordova, Cebu</p>

        <p>
          One of the things that make me excited every day is my hobbies. I have many things that I enjoy doing. One of my favorite hobbies is photo editing. I love taking pictures, and then I use different tools to make them look even better. Sometimes I add colors, change the background, or even add fun effects to make the pictures look creative. It’s amazing how much I can change a simple photo just by editing it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another hobby I have is video editing. I like creating videos that tell stories or share information. Editing videos is so fun because I can make them look professional by adding cool transitions, music, and even special effects. Whether it’s for a short video on social media or something longer, I enjoy every part of the process.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also enjoy creating content about random fascinating facts. I love learning new things, and when I find interesting facts, I feel excited to share them with other people. Example: did you know honey never spoils? Archaeologists found pots of honey in ancient tombs that are still edible!
        </p>

        <p>
          I also do blogging, side-scrolling gaming, and discovering phone & computer tips and tricks, and I enjoy sharing these finds with others.
